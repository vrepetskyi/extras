# [***Hack Yeah 2022***](https://github.com/vrepetskyi/garbage-collector)

This year we've decided to compete in "Less waste" category.

## First concept

Created by me on the way to Krak√≥w.

An interactive educational app about waste segregation. Its features should've included:
- basic guides on the topic
- advanced search on waste types (sometimes it is really difficult to decide which bin to throw it in)
- AR and Computer Vision usage for waste classification based on a video stream

## The submission

A fullstack Tinder-like application for peole who want to:
- get rid of their old staff easily
- try their luck in finding a valuable item

We have came up with a concept, created an MVP and deployed it in under 24h.
